#Aurduino Basic
Microcontroler is the primary circuit which allows us to program the Arduino in order for it to be able to execute commands. Digital Input/output pins, USB Interface and Connector, Analog Pins, Reset Button, LED's, and Voltage Regulator. 
loop allows us to run the code repeatedly where as the setup function allows us to set up the input and output pin.
An analog signal can take on any number of values. A digital signal on the other hand, has only two values: HIGH and LOW. 

#Electronic Component.
A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit.
The purpose of jumper wire is to connect two points in a circuit without soldering.Ex;connection of servo motor
LEDs allow the current to flow in the forward direction and blocks the current in the reverse direction where as regular diode allows current to flow in different direction.

#programing
A loop in is a function which allows the code excute again and again.Ex-void loop() {for (int angle = 0; angle <= 180; angle++) {servoMotor.write(angle); 
Functions are blocks of reusable code that usually perform a single action. 

#terminal usage
The command we use to list all files and directories in current directory is 'ls'.
The purpose of cd command in terminal is to change the directory.
The differences between ll and ls is that ls shows all the files and directory and ll shows all the hidden file and directory.
Done.
