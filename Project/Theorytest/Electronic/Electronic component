A resistor is an electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of electrical current in an electronic circuit.
The purpose of jumper wire is to connect two points in a circuit without soldering.Ex;connection of servo motor
LEDs allow the current to flow in the forward direction and blocks the current in the reverse direction where as regular diode allows current to flow in different direction.
